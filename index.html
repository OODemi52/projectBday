<!--This is an HTML comment (very annoyinhg to type I know lol).-->

<!--This is some boilerplate code that we will use for our project-->
<!--Boilerplate Definition: "computer language text that you can reuse with little or no alteration in several different contexts".-->
<!--Basicallly, code that is often reused from program to program, in this case, the HTML code you see below always appears in most programs.-->
<!--Boilerplate exists for every language, and there are even boilerplate generators that you can fnd online for different languages and use cases.-->
<!--This was generated by Github Copilot, but you can easily look up "HTML Boilerplate" and find what you need.-->

<!--Usually, you don't need to write comment for HTML because the HTML explains itself, but in this case I will write some to explain the boilerplate.-->
<!--To keep things looking clean (an important part of beong a software developer) I will explain the comment here and reference specific code im reffering to.-->

<!--Before we jump, I'll give a brief overview (or more accurately, I'm going to ask Copilot to do it lol) of HTML and its syntax. This wont be a complete guide, so you research anything you have questions on.-->
<!-- 
    HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language for creating web pages.
    It uses tags to define the structure and elements of a web page.
    The syntax of HTML consists of opening and closing tags, attributes, and content.
    HTML tags are enclosed in angle brackets (<>) and can be nested to create a hierarchical structure.
    The content between the opening and closing tags represents the information displayed on the web page, and are
    together reffered to as an HTML element.
-->
<!--So as Copilot has so generously imfored us, HTML is a language used to create webpages. It is the backbone of the web, and used for practically all websites.-->
